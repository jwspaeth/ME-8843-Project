# ME-8843-Project

This is the repo for the final project of ME 8843 Optimization for Robotics. The goal is to replicate the results of the paper, "Model-Based Reinforcement Learning via Latent-Space Collocation", on four Gymnasium environments. While my implementation is only partially successful on one environment, implementing it from scratch was educational and I intend to use this repository to seed future projects.
